# Game Theory: Nash Existence Theorem and Minimax Theorem

## <center> Abstract </center>
Nash equilibrium is the solution of a non-cooperative game named by John Nash. John Nash proved that nash equilibrium always exists when the number of game players is finite and the number of pure strategies also finitely. In this seminar, I introduce several definitions of game theory, Nash’s existence theorem, and definitions of strategies.
