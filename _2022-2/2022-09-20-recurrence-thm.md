# Poincaré Recurrence Theorem

## <center> Abstract </center>

Henri Poincaré showed that if the system has a fixed total energy
that restricts its dynamics to bounded subsets of its phaase space,
the system will eventually return as closely as someone like to any
given initial set of particle positions and velocities. However, one
can argue that this kind of recurrences are inconsistent with the second
law of thermodynamics. Even though the recurrence time is too
large to observe, this theoretical discussions enlightened perspective
of mankinds about nature. In this seminar, we will discuss how to
prove the theorem in a modern way and apply it to the dynamical
systems.
